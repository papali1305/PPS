# Retro Computer Personal Website

https://edh.dev/ (formerly edwardh.io)

This was a project I built for fun over one of my uni breaks, built in TypeScript and THREE.js, it contains a number of nifty features such as:
- 3D retro computer that you can interact with
- very simple UNIX shell implementation
- files system implementation
- markdown interpreter and renderer
- text layout engine
